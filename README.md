# AVR128DBXX Controller

The purpose of this project is to create a serial programmable relay controller (PLC similar). Taking advantage of the Microchip's Technology AVR128DB48 microcontroller characteristics.

The second parallel purpose is to demonstrate the C language bare metal programming for this microcontroller family using the AVR-GCC compiler and the Visual Studio Based IDE: Microchip Studio.
