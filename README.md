# AVR128DBXX Controller

![IC AVR128DB48](/img/AVR128DB48_IC_Zoom_image.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to create a serial programmable relay controller (PLC similar). Taking advantage of the Microchip's Technology AVR128DB48 microcontroller characteristics.

The second parallel purpose is to demonstrate the C language bare metal programming for this microcontroller family using the AVR-GCC compiler and the Visual Studio Based IDE: Microchip Studio.

## Current State

As 02/04/2023 the firmware allows the user to change the state of the relays manually using a USART CLI with argumented commands.

**For example:**

`$ ctrl 1,3 -tgl`

All commands must start with the $ sign, then the main command, followed by the selected elements and finally the operations, the above command will toggle the state of the selected relays.
